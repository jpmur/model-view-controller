# Model View Controller

This project is an implementation of the MVC design pattern in the context of a signal generator.
* The model layer is responsible for generating Gaussian and sinusoidal data sets.
* The view layer is used to render the generated data sets using various user defined parameter such as amplitude, frequency, phase and number of data points.
* The controller is used to output the desired data to the user.
